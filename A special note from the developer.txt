CSS Studio was my first big web application project initially named 'jadgets'. I started developing it in November 2018
with the motive to test what i had learned in web development in previous years. During it's development i decided to launch
it as a startup which i did in May 2019. Fortunately, within a couple of months it failed miserably and i ended up shutting it
down due to unavailability of funds to keep the servers running. It was definitely not a good decision, i did not do the planning
and had no experience in running a business but it taught me a lot of things. Although it's not something unimaginable but because
it is very unlikely that i will relaunch it as a startup, today on 17th August 2021 i have decided to open source it with the hope
of seeing it become something i had envisioned. Thank you for reading.
